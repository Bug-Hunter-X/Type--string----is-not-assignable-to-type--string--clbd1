# TypeScript Type Error: Type 'string[]' is not assignable to type 'string'

This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error: assigning an array of strings to a variable expecting a single string. The `greeter` function expects a single string, but the `user` variable is an array.  The solution involves modifying the function or the variable to ensure type compatibility.
